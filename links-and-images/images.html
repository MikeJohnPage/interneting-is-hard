  <img src="images/mochi.svg">
  <p>JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs are all <i>raster</i> graphics. This means they use
  a bitmap (grid of pixels) to display the image. This means the images don't
  scale well. SVG's on the other hand are <i>vector</i> graphics, meaning they
  are defined in terms of points on a Cartesian plane. This means they scale
  up and down well.</p>
